/**
 * Band-limited double integration, done in the frequency domain.
 *
 * Getting displacement from acceleration by summing twice in the time domain
 * is the obvious approach and it is a trap: any constant offset becomes a
 * ramp and then a parabola, so the answer drifts away from the data. The
 * usual patches (high-pass the result, detrend after each pass) are
 * approximate and interact with the band you care about.
 *
 * In the frequency domain integration is exact. Each integration divides by
 * i*omega, so integrating twice multiplies by -1/omega^2:
 *
 *     X_displacement(f) = -X_acceleration(f) / (2*pi*f)^2
 *
 * Drift is the f -> 0 limit of that expression, which is why it blows up, and
 * why band-limiting first is not a cleanup step but a precondition. Zeroing
 * everything outside the tremor band removes the singularity before it can do
 * any damage, and it is also exactly what we want physically: we are asking
 * how far the hand moved BECAUSE OF THE TREMOR, not where the arm drifted to.
 *
 * Returns displacement in metres, same length as the input.

  // A Hann taper is the right thing for estimating a SPECTRUM, because it
  // trades resolution for leakage and neither of those affects where a peak
  // sits. It is the wrong thing for reconstructing an AMPLITUDE, because the
  // taper multiplies the signal by an envelope that is never removed. An
  // earlier version windowed here, and the recovered displacement then had
  // the Hann shape baked into it: a true 2.000 mm amplitude read as 0.778 mm
  // one fifth of the way into the record and 1.991 mm at the centre.
  //
  // Peak-to-peak survived that almost intact, because the peak lands near the
  // middle where the gain is 1, which is exactly why it went unnoticed. The
  // HOLD FRACTION did not: most of the evaluated record had been pulled
  // toward the centre of the target, so every published hold rate was too
  // generous and the finding looked weaker than it is.
