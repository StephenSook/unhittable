/**
 * Turn one PADS recording into a two-dimensional cursor path in millimetres.
 *
 * Two axes, not the magnitude, because a cursor moves in a plane and a button
 * is a rectangle, and collapsing to a scalar would throw away the geometry
 * that decides whether a click lands.
 *
 * ON THE FRAME, AND ON A CORRECTION THAT WAS REMOVED AGAIN.
 *
 * A rotating accelerometer that carries gravity fabricates apparent movement,
 * because tilting changes how much gravity falls on each axis. That is real,
 * and this project briefly shipped a gyroscope-based attitude correction for
 * it.
 *
 * The correction was then removed, because PADS does not carry gravity. Its
 * accelerometer channel is already gravity-free, the way CoreMotion's
 * userAcceleration is: the mean magnitude across these records is 0.001 to
 * 0.14 g rather than the ~1 g a gravity-bearing channel shows. So the
 * confound's mechanism is absent, and the filter that was supposed to remove
 * it was deriving attitude from noise. See docs/FALSE-GREENS.md entry 14.
 *
 * What remains true is that the device's axes are not fixed in space, so
 * which way "x" points is arbitrary. That is handled where it actually
 * matters, in geometry.js, by publishing the worst hold across azimuths
 * rather than by pretending a heading is known.
